# PS_T-SQL_Dashboard
Powershell Dashboard for TSQL

This is intended to be a homemade performance "dashboard" for MS SQL Server. I intend to query (TSQL) the server and database via POWERSHELL with the actual dashboard displaying in HTML. I suspect the HTML will also need some CSS but that will depend on how well POWERSHELL creates the HTML output.

File Types:
  (PS1)  POWERSHELL
  (HTML) HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE
  (CSS)  CASCADING STYLE SHEET (may not be needed)
  (SQL)  STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE (may not be needed)
